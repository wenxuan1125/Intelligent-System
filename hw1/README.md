# Intelligent System HW1 README

I wrote two different "load.py" for each of the task. They were named "load_task1.py" and "load_task2.py" respectively.

For task 1:
First, enter "load_task1.py" to record the front-view image and the top-view image (need to chage the values of some parameters in code so that the photos could be taken from different views).
Second, enter "python bev.py" to run the program.

For task 2:
First, enter "load_task2.py" to record the scene and the camera pose. The recored images would be stored in "./task2_data/color" for rgb images, "./task2_data/depth" for depth images and "./task2_data/camera_pose.csv" for camera pose. (For taking photos at Floor 1 or Floor 2, changing the values of parameters in code is needed).
Second, enter "python reconstruct.py" to run the program.

For the detail about the tasks, please check "HW1_spec.docx.pdf". 
For the result and the explaination of the codes, please check "report.pdf".
