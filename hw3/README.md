After choosing the starting point, press any keyboard button (e.g. "ENTER") to exit the image window. Then RRT algorithm will be exercuted to find a path from starting point to the taget point. The result will then be shown on the screen as below. You can press any keyboard button (e.g. "ENTER") to exit the image window.

If a path is found, then the agent will be navigated according to the found path. In order to observe each action the agent takes clearly, you need to press "ENTER" to trigger the agent to take the next action after it completes an action.    
The following picture is what the agent sees when it completes an action. You need to press "ENTER" to let it exercute the next action. The same process until the last action.
